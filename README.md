An OpenSource Minecraft Server

#Concept
##What is this?
This is a project dedicated to making a server truely ran by the community. Everything from server plugins, configurations, banned players, and source codes are put in this repo.

This project is a social experiment to see how well a community can withstand itself if it's ran by itself.

To join the server, the IP is `coming soon`

##How does it work?
Simple! If you want to, let's say, add a plugin. Simply fork this repo, add the plugin to the `server` folder and submit a pull request.

If enough people in the community agree that your pull request is a valuable pull request, then it will be merged into the repo and downloaded onto the server within 24 hours.

##Can I contribute?
Sure! Be sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/GamezGalaxy2/OpenMC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file before
submitting a pull request!
