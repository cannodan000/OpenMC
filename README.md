An OpenSource Minecraft Server

#What is this?
This is a project dedicated to making a server truely ran by the community. Everything from server plugins, configurations, banned players, and source codes are put in this repo.

This project is a social experiment to see how well a community can withstand itself if it's ran by itself.

To join the server, the IP is `coming soon`

#How does it work?
Simple! If you want to, let's say, add a plugin. Simply fork this repo, add the plugin to the "server" folder and submit a pull request.

If enough people in the community agree that your pull request is a valuable pull request, then it will be merged into the repo and downloaded onto the server within 24 hours.

#Are there any rules?
Yes, read the full set of rules on the wiki

#What if someone breaks these rules?
There github username will be added to the .pullignore file and all there pull requests will be closed as soon as they are opened.
